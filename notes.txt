# I/O Tasks (I/O-Bound)
IO (Input/Output) tasks would be anything that performs an external connection - be it an HTTP request or storing scraped data to a database

# CPU Tasks (CPU-bound)
CPU tasks such as parsing scraped HTMLs, loading JSON data, natural language parsing, and so on.

To deal with perfomance in web scraping projects:
So to summarize all of this: multi processing for CPU performance and asyncio for IO performance.

Async Requests
IO block is when our program has to wait for an external system to respond.
For example, making a HTTP connection - our program sends a request and waits for the web server to send it a response. This could be several seconds of waiting.

Asynchronous programs use a manager (called an event loop) that can pause some functions and let others take over in the meantime.
In other words, while one IO-blocking operation (like a request) is waiting the event loop will let the other operations take over.
